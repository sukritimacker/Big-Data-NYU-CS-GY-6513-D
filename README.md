# Big-Data-NYU-CS-GY-6513-D

### Course Description
This course introduces the architectures and technologies at the foundation of the Big Data
movement. These technologies facilitate scalable management and processing of vast quantities of
data collected through near real-time sensing and bulk data ingest.
Big Data requires the storage, organization, and processing of data at a scale and efficiency that go
well beyond the capabilities of conventional information technologies. The course reviews the state
of the art in Big Data analytics frameworks and in addition to covering the specifics of different
platforms, models, and languages, students will look at real applications and patterns that perform
massive data analysis and how they can be implemented on Big Data platforms.
Topics discussed include Distributed Data processing platforms: Map reduce/Hadoop, Apache Spark
and Dask; Distributed data stores: NoSQL and MongoDB; and large-scale data mining patterns.
The curriculum will primarily consist of technical readings and discussions and will also include
programming projects where participants will prototype data-intensive applications using existing
Big Data tools and platforms.

### Course Objectives
1. To learn about basic concepts, technical challenges, and opportunities in big data management and
big data analysis technologies.
2. To learn about common algorithmic and statistical techniques used to perform big data analysis.

3. To learn and get hands-on experience in using some data analysis and management tools such as
Hadoop MapReduce, and others.
4. To learn about different types of scenarios and applications in big data analysis, including for
structured, semi structured, and unstructured data.

We will use a suitable combination of technologies, including virtual machines, containers and
cloud-based technologies (VM, Cloudera Hadoop, AWS, Azure) for completing homework and
projects. Students may also opt to create their own cloud-based Hadoop clusters.
